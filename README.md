## Everyone is John

Based on the popular [table-top role-playing-game](https://rtwolf.github.io/Everyone-is-John/),
We created a web-based multiplayed cooperative story-telling game where the rules are simple: everyone is john. Each player takes turns controlling our protagonist, John, in order to complete their hidden objectives using a set of predetermined skills.

The gameplay is relatively straightforward: players select their skills and objectives in private and then join a video call. Each player starts with ten tokens. The players use these tokens to bid for control of John. Then, the AI Game Master sets the scene for our players, and the player that bid the most gets a chance to describe to the Game Master what action they would like John to take.

Think of it like a choose your own adventure game with AI-generated storylines, where the possibilities are endless.

If a player can successfully reach their secret objective, they score points based on its associated difficulty. Once all players are out of tokens, the game ends and the player with the most points from reaching their objective wins.

This project leverages Pinata for all our asset-sharing needs, allowing for nearly instantaneaous access to AI-generated assets.

It also uses Amazon Bedrock to facilitate all communication with Large Language and Image Diffusion models.

Finally, the project uses the Zoom SDK to maintain the most important part of any ttrpg, live-action storytelling and player interaction.
