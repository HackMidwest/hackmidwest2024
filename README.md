## What is the name of your App?
PixelForge
<br /><br />
## What does your app do?
PixelForge is a cutting-edge prototype that enables on-the-go image editing powered by AI/ML models. It utilizes an ESP32 camera, which is remotely linked to Dropbox via an API, automatically storing each captured image. OpenShiftAI then retrieves the image data from Dropbox using an access token. From there, users can seamlessly apply one of three available stylization models to transform their images.
